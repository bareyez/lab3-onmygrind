# Web Development Lab 3 - *On My Grind â˜•*

Submitted by: **Bryan Reyes**

This web app: **This project was created as a Starbucks drink receipe simulator. The user is given a random drink and chooses from the list of ingredients to quiz themselves on their knowledge of Starbucks drinks.**

Time spent: **24** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **One drink at a time is displayed**
- [X] **The user can click one option for each of the four categories to input their answer**
- [X] **The selected option populates into the box above, and if an option is already int he box, it is replaced by the new option**
- [X] **Clicking "check answer" submits the answer to be checked for correctness**
- [X] **After clicking "check answer", the user can see which components of a drink they entered correctly and incorrectly by having the box for that answer change visually**

## Notes

The learning curve in regards to handling user input in a variety of different ways was steep, but the lab made the concepts fun to learn! I believe the most difficult part of the lab, in my opinion, was adjusting the CSS to make the app more user-friendly and uniform with all components.
